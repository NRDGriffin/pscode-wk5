// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

add target number to formula x/2=? where x is target number
run calculation
if remainder =0, report even
if remainder =1, report odd

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

Parse data set max 5 digits
order numbers from smallest to largest
add numbers to formula x+x+x+x+x/5=? where each x=one digit from data set
run calculation
report: minimum as first number in ordered set, maximum as last digit in ordered set, and average as result of formula
